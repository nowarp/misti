/**
 * An optional detector that highlights all the `dump` function calls.
 *
 * ## Why is it bad?
 * The `dump` function is a debug print that shouldn't be in the final code.
 * Even though the compiler removes it in production, its presence suggests the
 * developer was debugging something. This can flag areas where issues might exist,
 * so auditors should take a closer look at these parts of the code.
 *
 * ## Example
 * ```tact
 * fun test(): Int {
 *   // ... other computations
 *   let combined: Int = (RANDOM_SEED >> half_shift) &
 *                       (MAGIC_CONSTANT << DIVIDE_BY_TWO) ^ shift_mask;
 *   dump(combined); // Suspicious: Highlighted by the detector
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Use instead:
 * ```tact
 * fun test(): Int {
 *   // ... other computations
 *   let combined: Int = this.seed ^ shift_mask
 *   // OK: The code was reviewed and simplified; `dump` was removed
 * }
 * ```
