[LOW] PreferSenderFunction: Using gas-expensive `context().sender`
test/detectors/PreferSenderFunction.tact:5:17:
  4 |     receive("1") {
> 5 |         let s = context().sender; // Bad: replace w/ sender()
                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  6 |     }
Help: Consider replacing it with less gas-expensive `sender()` call

[LOW] PreferSenderFunction: Code can be optimized by using `sender()` instead of accessing context
test/detectors/PreferSenderFunction.tact:8:13:
  7 |     receive("2") {
> 8 |         let ctx = context(); // Bad: Only .sender is accessed
                  ^~~
  9 |         let s = ctx.sender;
The `ctx` variable is only used to get the sender
Help: Consider replacing `ctx.sender` with the less gas-expensive `sender()` call
