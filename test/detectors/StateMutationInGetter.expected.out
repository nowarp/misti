[INFO] StateMutationInGetter: Getter contains direct state mutation logic
test/detectors/StateMutationInGetter.tact:11:9:
  10 |     get fun badDirectMutation(): Int {
> 11 |         self.value = self.value + 1; // BAD Direct state mutation
               ^
  12 |         return self.value;
Getter methods typically shouldn't contain state-modifying logic as this may confuse developers who expect them to be read-only
Help: Consider moving state-modifying logic to a non-getter function for clarity
