Here's the updated text with the grammar fixed:

# Tests

## Structure

The following directories contain contracts:

- `all` – contains various contracts for which most tests are executed. You should not add new tests there if possible, since these execution is quite slow.
- `detectors` – contains contracts named after each detector. See `builtinDetectors.spec.ts` to understand how it is used.
